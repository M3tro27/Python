The\r\n'b'time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\r\n'b'to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\n'b'searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\r\n'b'projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\r\n'b'per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\n'b'million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\r\n'b'files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\r\n'b'If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\r\n'b'total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\r\n'b'Files by December 31, 2001.

Long liue the King\r\n'b'\r\n'b'***\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\r\n'b'or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the\r\n'b'original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\r\n'b'to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\r\n'b'that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\r\n'b'above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\r\n'b'Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a\r\n'b'time when they were out of "v"\'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in\r\n'b'place of some "w"\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\r\n'b"as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend\r\n"b'more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I\r\n'b'have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an\r\n'b'extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\r\n'b'very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\r\n'b'assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\r\n'b'in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\r\n'b'purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\r\n'b'. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\r\n'b'that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\r\n'b'variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\r\n'b'for signing his name with several different spellings.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So, please take this into account when reading the comments below\r\n'b'made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\r\n'b'that are "not" errors. . . .\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\r\n'b"here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie\r\n"b'of Hamlet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Michael S.

This was taken from\r\n"b"a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can\r\n"b'come in ASCII to the printed text.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the\r\n"b'conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\r\n'b'punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\r\n'b'printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\r\n'b'together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\r\n'b"Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified\r\n"b"spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded\r\n"b'abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\r\n'b"brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that\r\n"b'you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\r\n'b'purer Shakespeare.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\r\n'b'differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\r\n'b'be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\r\n'b"this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's\r\n"b'habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\r\n'b'then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\r\n'b"continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but\r\n"b'incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\r\n'b'The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different\r\n'b"First Folio editions' best pages.\r\n"b'\r\n'b'If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\r\n'b'errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\r\n'b'free to email me those errors.

In what particular thought to work, I know not:\r\n'b'But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,\r\n'b'This boades some strange erruption to our State\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Mar. Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes\r\n'b'Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,\r\n'b'So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,\r\n'b'And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon\r\n'b'And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:\r\n'b'Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske\r\n'b"Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,\r\n"b'What might be toward, that this sweaty hast\r\n'b'Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:\r\n'b"Who is't that can informe me?\r\n"b'  Hor. That can I,\r\n'b'At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,\r\n'b"Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,\r\n"b'Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,\r\n'b"(Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)\r\n"b"Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,\r\n"b"(For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)\r\n"b"Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,\r\n"b'Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,\r\n'b'Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands\r\n'b"Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:\r\n"b'Against the which, a Moity competent\r\n'b"Was gaged by our King: which had return'd\r\n"b'To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,\r\n'b"Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant\r\n"b'And carriage of the Article designe,\r\n'b'His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,\r\n'b'Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,\r\n'b'Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,\r\n'b"Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,\r\n"b'For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize\r\n'b"That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other\r\n"b'(And it doth well appeare vnto our State)\r\n'b'But to recouer of vs by strong hand\r\n'b'And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands\r\n'b'So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)\r\n'b'Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,\r\n'b'The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head\r\n'b'Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.\r\n'b'Enter Ghost againe.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:\r\n'b'Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:\r\n'b'If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,\r\n'b'Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,\r\n'b'That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.\r\n'b'If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate\r\n'b'(Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.\r\n'b'Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life\r\n'b'Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,\r\n'b'(For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)\r\n'b'Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?\r\n'b'  Hor. Do, if it will not stand\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Barn. 'Tis heere\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Hor. 'Tis heere\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Mar. 'Tis gone.\r\n"b'\r\n'b'Exit Ghost.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall\r\n'b'To offer it the shew of Violence,\r\n'b'For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,\r\n'b'And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Barn. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing\r\n'b'Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,\r\n'b'The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,\r\n'b'Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate\r\n'b'Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,\r\n'b'Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,\r\n'b"Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes\r\n"b'To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,\r\n'b'This present Obiect made probation\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Mar. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.\r\n'b"Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes\r\n"b'Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,\r\n'b'The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:\r\n'b'And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,\r\n'b'The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,\r\n'b'No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:\r\n'b"So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Hor. So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.\r\n'b'But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,\r\n'b"Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,\r\n"b'Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice\r\n'b'Let vs impart what we haue seene to night\r\n'b'Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,\r\n'b'This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:\r\n'b'Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\r\n'b'As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?\r\n'b"  Mar. Let do't I pray, and I this morning know\r\n"b'Where we shall finde him most conueniently.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Scena Secunda.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,\r\n'b'Polonius,\r\n'b'Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death\r\n'b'The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted\r\n'b'To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome\r\n'b'To be contracted in one brow of woe:\r\n'b'Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,\r\n'b'That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,\r\n'b'Together with remembrance of our selues.\r\n'b'Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,\r\n'b"Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,\r\n"b"Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,\r\n"b'With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,\r\n'b'With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,\r\n'b'In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole\r\n'b"Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd\r\n"b'Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone\r\n'b'With this affaire along, for all our Thankes.\r\n'b'Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras,\r\n'b'Holding a weake supposall of our worth;\r\n'b'Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,\r\n'b'Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,\r\n'b'Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;\r\n'b"He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,\r\n"b'Importing the surrender of those Lands\r\n'b'Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law\r\n'b'To our most valiant Brother. So much for him.\r\n'b'Enter Voltemand and Cornelius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting\r\n'b'Thus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ\r\n'b'To Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,\r\n'b'Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares\r\n'b'Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse\r\n'b'His further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,\r\n'b'The Lists, and full proportions are all made\r\n'b'Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch\r\n'b'You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,\r\n'b'For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,\r\n'b'Giuing to you no further personall power\r\n'b'To businesse with the King, more then the scope\r\n'b'Of these dilated Articles allow:\r\n'b'Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Volt. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit Voltemand and Cornelius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?\r\n"b"You told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?\r\n"b'You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,\r\n'b"And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,\r\n"b'That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?\r\n'b'The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,\r\n'b'The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,\r\n'b'Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.\r\n'b"What would'st thou haue Laertes?\r\n"b'  Laer. Dread my Lord,\r\n'b'Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,\r\n'b'From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke\r\n'b'To shew my duty in your Coronation,\r\n'b'Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,\r\n'b'My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,\r\n'b'And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Haue you your Fathers leaue?\r\n'b'What sayes Pollonius?\r\n'b'  Pol. He hath my Lord:\r\n'b'I do beseech you giue him leaue to go\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,\r\n'b'And thy best graces spend it at thy will:\r\n'b'But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?\r\n'b'  Ham. A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?\r\n'b"  Ham. Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,\r\n'b'And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.\r\n'b'Do not for euer with thy veyled lids\r\n'b'Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;\r\n'b"Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,\r\n"b'Passing through Nature, to Eternity\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I Madam, it is common\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Queen. If it be;\r\n'b'Why seemes it so particular with thee\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:\r\n'b"'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)\r\n"b'Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,\r\n'b"Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,\r\n"b'No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,\r\n'b'Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,\r\n'b'Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,\r\n'b'That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,\r\n'b'For they are actions that a man might play:\r\n'b'But I haue that Within, which passeth show;\r\n'b'These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   King. 'Tis sweet and commendable\r\n"b'In your Nature Hamlet,\r\n'b'To giue these mourning duties to your Father:\r\n'b'But you must know, your Father lost a Father,\r\n'b'That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound\r\n'b'In filiall Obligation, for some terme\r\n'b'To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer\r\n'b'In obstinate Condolement, is a course\r\n'b"Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,\r\n"b'It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,\r\n'b'A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,\r\n'b"An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:\r\n"b'For, what we know must be, and is as common\r\n'b'As any the most vulgar thing to sence,\r\n'b'Why should we in our peeuish Opposition\r\n'b"Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,\r\n"b'A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,\r\n'b'To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame\r\n'b'Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,\r\n'b'From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,\r\n'b'This must be so. We pray you throw to earth\r\n'b'This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs\r\n'b'As of a Father; For let the world take note,\r\n'b'You are the most immediate to our Throne,\r\n'b'And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,\r\n'b'Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,\r\n'b'Do I impart towards you. For your intent\r\n'b'In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,\r\n'b'It is most retrograde to our desire:\r\n'b'And we beseech you, bend you to remaine\r\n'b'Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,\r\n'b'Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:\r\n'b'I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I shall in all my best\r\n'b'Obey you Madam\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   King. Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,\r\n"b'Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,\r\n'b"This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet\r\n"b'Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,\r\n'b'No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,\r\n'b'But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,\r\n'b'And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,\r\n'b'Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Manet Hamlet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,\r\n'b'Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:\r\n'b'Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt\r\n'b"His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!\r\n"b'How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable\r\n'b'Seemes to me all the vses of this world?\r\n'b"Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden\r\n"b'That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature\r\n'b'Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this:\r\n'b'But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,\r\n'b'So excellent a King, that was to this\r\n'b'Hiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,\r\n'b'That he might not beteene the windes of heauen\r\n'b'Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth\r\n'b'Must I remember: why she would hang on him,\r\n'b'As if encrease of Appetite had growne\r\n'b'By what is fed on; and yet within a month?\r\n'b"Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.\r\n"b'A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,\r\n'b'With which she followed my poore Fathers body\r\n'b'Like Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.\r\n'b'(O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason\r\n'b"Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,\r\n"b'My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,\r\n'b'Then I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?\r\n'b'Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares\r\n'b'Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,\r\n'b'She married. O most wicked speed, to post\r\n'b'With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:\r\n'b'It is not, nor it cannot come to good.\r\n'b'But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\r\n'b'Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Hor. Haile to your Lordship\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I am glad to see you well:\r\n'b'Horatio, or I do forget my selfe\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. The same my Lord,\r\n'b'And your poore Seruant euer\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Sir my good friend,\r\n'b'Ile change that name with you:\r\n'b'And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?\r\n'b'Marcellus\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Mar. My good Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.\r\n'b'But what in faith make you from Wittemberge?\r\n'b'  Hor. A truant disposition, good my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I would not haue your Enemy say so;\r\n'b'Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,\r\n'b'To make it truster of your owne report\r\n'b'Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:\r\n'b'But what is your affaire in Elsenour?\r\n'b"Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Hor. My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)\r\n'b'I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats\r\n'b'Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;\r\n'b'Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,\r\n'b'Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio.\r\n'b'My father, me thinkes I see my father\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Oh where my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. In my minds eye (Horatio)\r\n'b'  Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly King\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all:\r\n'b'I shall not look vpon his like againe\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Saw? Who?\r\n'b'  Hor. My Lord, the King your Father\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. The King my Father?\r\n'b'  Hor. Season your admiration for a while\r\n'b'With an attent eare; till I may deliuer\r\n'b'Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,\r\n'b'This maruell to you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen\r\n'b'(Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch\r\n'b'In the dead wast and middle of the night\r\n'b'Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,\r\n'b"Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,\r\n"b'Appeares before them, and with sollemne march\r\n'b'Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,\r\n'b'By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,\r\n'b"Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd\r\n"b'Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,\r\n'b'Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me\r\n'b'In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,\r\n'b'And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,\r\n'b"Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,\r\n"b'Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,\r\n'b'The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:\r\n'b'These hands are not more like\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. But where was this?\r\n'b'  Mar. My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Did you not speake to it?\r\n'b'  Hor. My Lord, I did;\r\n'b'But answere made it none: yet once me thought\r\n'b'It lifted vp it head, and did addresse\r\n'b'It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:\r\n'b'But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;\r\n'b'And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,\r\n'b'And vanisht from our sight\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Tis very strange\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;\r\n"b'And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty\r\n'b'To let you know of it\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.\r\n'b'Hold you the watch to Night?\r\n'b'  Both. We doe my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Arm'd, say you?\r\n"b"  Both. Arm'd, my Lord\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. From top to toe?\r\n'b'  Both. My Lord, from head to foote\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Then saw you not his face?\r\n'b'  Hor. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. What, lookt he frowningly?\r\n'b'  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Pale, or red?\r\n'b'  Hor. Nay very pale\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?\r\n'b'  Hor. Most constantly\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I would I had beene there\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?\r\n'b'  Hor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   All. Longer, longer\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hor. Not when I saw't\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. His Beard was grisly? no\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. It was, as I haue seene it in his life,\r\n'b"A Sable Siluer'd\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Hor. I warrant you it will\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. If it assume my noble Fathers person,\r\n'b'Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape\r\n'b'And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\r\n'b'If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;\r\n'b'Let it bee treble in your silence still:\r\n'b'And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,\r\n'b'Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;\r\n'b'I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:\r\n'b'Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,\r\n'b'Ile visit you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   All. Our duty to your Honour.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.\r\n'b'My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well:\r\n'b'I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;\r\n'b'Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,\r\n'b'Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.\r\n'b'Enter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Scena Tertia\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Laertes and Ophelia.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  Laer. My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:\r\n"b'And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,\r\n'b'And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,\r\n'b'But let me heare from you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophel. Doe you doubt that?\r\n'b'  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,\r\n'b'Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;\r\n'b'A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;\r\n'b'Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting\r\n'b'The suppliance of a minute? No more\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophel. No more but so\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Thinke it no more:\r\n'b'For nature cressant does not grow alone,\r\n'b'In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,\r\n'b'The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule\r\n'b'Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,\r\n'b'And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch\r\n'b'The vertue of his feare: but you must feare\r\n'b"His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;\r\n"b'For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:\r\n'b'Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,\r\n'b'Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends\r\n'b'The sanctity and health of the whole State.\r\n'b"And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd\r\n"b'Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,\r\n'b'Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,\r\n'b'It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;\r\n'b'As he in his peculiar Sect and force\r\n'b'May giue his saying deed: which is no further,\r\n'b'Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.\r\n'b'Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,\r\n'b'If with too credent eare you list his Songs;\r\n'b'Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open\r\n'b'To his vnmastred importunity.\r\n'b'Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,\r\n'b'And keepe within the reare of your Affection;\r\n'b'Out of the shot and danger of Desire.\r\n'b'The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,\r\n'b'If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:\r\n'b'Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,\r\n'b'The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring\r\n'b"Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,\r\n"b'And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,\r\n'b'Contagious blastments are most imminent.\r\n'b'Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;\r\n'b'Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ophe. I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,\r\n"b'As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother\r\n'b'Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,\r\n'b'Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;\r\n'b'Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine\r\n'b'Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,\r\n'b'And reaks not his owne reade\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Oh, feare me not.\r\n'b'Enter Polonius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'I stay too long; but here my Father comes:\r\n'b'A double blessing is a double grace;\r\n'b'Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Yet heere Laertes? Aboord, aboord for shame,\r\n'b'The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,\r\n'b'And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;\r\n'b'And these few Precepts in thy memory,\r\n'b'See thou Character. Giue thy thoughts no tongue,\r\n'b"Nor any vnproportion'd thoughts his Act:\r\n"b'Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:\r\n'b'The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,\r\n'b'Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:\r\n'b'But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment\r\n'b"Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. Beware\r\n"b'Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in\r\n'b"Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.\r\n"b'Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:\r\n'b'Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:\r\n'b'Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;\r\n'b'But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:\r\n'b'For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.\r\n'b'And they in France of the best ranck and station,\r\n'b'Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.\r\n'b'Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;\r\n'b'For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:\r\n'b'And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.\r\n'b'This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:\r\n'b'And it must follow, as the Night the Day,\r\n'b'Thou canst not then be false to any man.\r\n'b'Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Farewell Ophelia, and remember well\r\n'b'What I haue said to you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. Tis in my memory lockt,\r\n'b'And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Farewell.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit Laer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Polon. What ist Ophelia he hath said to you?\r\n'b'  Ophe. So please you, somthing touching the L[ord]. Hamlet\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Marry, well bethought:\r\n'b'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\r\n'b'Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe\r\n'b'Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.\r\n'b'If it be so, as so tis put on me;\r\n'b'And that in way of caution: I must tell you,\r\n'b'You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,\r\n'b'As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.\r\n'b'What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?\r\n'b'  Ophe. He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders\r\n'b'Of his affection to me\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,\r\n'b'Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.\r\n'b'Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?\r\n'b'  Ophe. I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,\r\n'b'That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,\r\n'b'Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;\r\n'b'Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,\r\n'b"Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Ophe. My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,\r\n"b'In honourable fashion\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. And hath giuen countenance to his speech,\r\n'b'My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know\r\n'b'When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule\r\n'b'Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,\r\n'b'Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,\r\n'b'Euen in their promise, as it is a making;\r\n'b'You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,\r\n'b'Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;\r\n'b'Set your entreatments at a higher rate,\r\n'b'Then a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\r\n'b'Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,\r\n'b'And with a larger tether may he walke,\r\n'b'Then may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,\r\n'b'Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,\r\n'b'Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:\r\n'b'But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,\r\n'b'Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,\r\n'b'The better to beguile. This is for all:\r\n'b'I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,\r\n'b'Haue you so slander any moment leisure,\r\n'b'As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:\r\n'b"Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. I shall obey my Lord.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?\r\n'b'  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager ayre\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. What hower now?\r\n'b'  Hor. I thinke it lacks of twelue\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Mar. No, it is strooke\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,\r\n'b'Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.\r\n'b'What does this meane my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,\r\n'b'Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,\r\n'b'And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,\r\n'b'The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out\r\n'b'The triumph of his Pledge\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Horat. Is it a custome?\r\n'b'  Ham. I marry ist;\r\n'b'And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,\r\n'b'And to the manner borne: It is a Custome\r\n'b"More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.\r\n"b'Enter Ghost.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Hor. Looke my Lord, it comes\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:\r\n'b"Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,\r\n"b'Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,\r\n'b'Be thy euents wicked or charitable,\r\n'b"Thou com'st in such a questionable shape\r\n"b'That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee Hamlet,\r\n'b'King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,\r\n'b'Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell\r\n'b"Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,\r\n"b'Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher\r\n'b"Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,\r\n"b"Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,\r\n"b'To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?\r\n'b'That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,\r\n'b'Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,\r\n'b'Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,\r\n'b'So horridly to shake our disposition,\r\n'b'With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,\r\n'b'Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ghost beckens Hamlet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Hor. It beckons you to goe away with it,\r\n'b'As if it some impartment did desire\r\n'b'To you alone\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Mar. Looke with what courteous action\r\n'b'It wafts you to a more remoued ground:\r\n'b'But doe not goe with it\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. No, by no meanes\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. It will not speake: then will I follow it\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Doe not my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Why, what should be the feare?\r\n'b'I doe not set my life at a pins fee;\r\n'b'And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?\r\n'b'Being a thing immortall as it selfe:\r\n'b'It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?\r\n'b'Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,\r\n'b"That beetles o're his base into the Sea,\r\n"b'And there assumes some other horrible forme,\r\n'b'Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,\r\n'b'And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?\r\n'b'  Ham. It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Mar. You shall not goe my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Hold off your hand\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hor. Be rul'd, you shall not goe\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. My fate cries out,\r\n'b'And makes each petty Artire in this body,\r\n'b'As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:\r\n'b"Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen:\r\n"b"By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:\r\n"b'I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt. Ghost & Hamlet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Mar. Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Haue after, to what issue will this come?\r\n'b'  Mar. Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Heauen will direct it\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Mar. Nay, let's follow him.\r\n"b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Ghost and Hamlet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no further\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Gho. Marke me\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I will\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Gho. My hower is almost come,\r\n'b'When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames\r\n'b'Must render vp my selfe\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Alas poore Ghost\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Gho. Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing\r\n'b'To what I shall vnfold\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Speake, I am bound to heare\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Gho. So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. What?\r\n'b'  Gho. I am thy Fathers Spirit,\r\n'b"Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;\r\n"b"And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,\r\n"b'Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature\r\n'b"Are burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbid\r\n"b'To tell the secrets of my Prison-House;\r\n'b'I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word\r\n'b'Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,\r\n'b'Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,\r\n'b'Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,\r\n'b'And each particular haire to stand an end,\r\n'b'Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:\r\n'b'But this eternall blason must not be\r\n'b'To eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list,\r\n'b'If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Oh Heauen!\r\n'b'  Gho. Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Murther?\r\n'b'  Ghost. Murther most foule, as in the best it is;\r\n'b'But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Hast, hast me to know it,\r\n'b'That with wings as swift\r\n'b'As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,\r\n'b'May sweepe to my Reuenge\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ghost. I finde thee apt,\r\n'b"And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede\r\n"b'That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,\r\n'b"Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now Hamlet heare:\r\n"b"It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,\r\n"b'A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,\r\n'b'Is by a forged processe of my death\r\n'b"Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,\r\n"b'The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,\r\n'b'Now weares his Crowne\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle?\r\n'b'  Ghost. I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast\r\n'b'With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.\r\n'b'Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power\r\n'b'So to seduce? Won to this shamefull Lust\r\n'b'The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:\r\n'b'Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,\r\n'b'From me, whose loue was of that dignity,\r\n'b'That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow\r\n'b'I made to her in Marriage; and to decline\r\n'b'Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore\r\n'b'To those of mine.

Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. I will my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,\r\n'b'Before you visite him you make inquiry\r\n'b'Of his behauiour\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. My Lord, I did intend it\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Marry, well said;\r\n'b'Very well said. Looke you Sir,\r\n'b'Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\r\n'b'And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:\r\n'b'What company, at what expence: and finding\r\n'b'By this encompassement and drift of question,\r\n'b'That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer\r\n'b'Then your particular demands will touch it,\r\n'b"Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,\r\n"b'And thus I know his father and his friends,\r\n'b'And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?\r\n'b'  Reynol. I, very well my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. And in part him, but you may say not well;\r\n'b"But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;\r\n"b'Addicted so and so; and there put on him\r\n'b'What forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,\r\n'b'As may dishonour him; take heed of that:\r\n'b'But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,\r\n'b'As are Companions noted and most knowne\r\n'b'To youth and liberty\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. As gaming my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,\r\n'b'Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. My Lord that would dishonour him\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;\r\n'b'You must not put another scandall on him,\r\n'b'That hee is open to Incontinencie;\r\n'b"That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,\r\n"b'That they may seeme the taints of liberty;\r\n'b'The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,\r\n'b"A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. But my good Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Wherefore should you doe this?\r\n'b'  Reynol. I my Lord, I would know that\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Polon. Marry Sir, heere's my drift,\r\n"b'And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:\r\n'b'You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,\r\n'b"As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:\r\n"b'Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound,\r\n'b'Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,\r\n'b"The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd\r\n"b'He closes with you in this consequence:\r\n'b'Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.\r\n'b'According to the Phrase and the Addition,\r\n'b'Of man and Country\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. Very good my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. And then Sir does he this?\r\n'b'He does: what was I about to say?\r\n'b'I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?\r\n'b'  Reynol. At closes in the consequence:\r\n'b'At friend, or so, and Gentleman\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. At closes in the consequence, I marry,\r\n'b'He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,\r\n'b'I saw him yesterday, or tother day;\r\n'b'Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,\r\n'b"There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,\r\n"b'There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,\r\n'b'I saw him enter such a house of saile;\r\n'b'Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now;\r\n'b'Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;\r\n'b'And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach\r\n'b'With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,\r\n'b'By indirections finde directions out:\r\n'b'So by my former Lecture and aduice\r\n'b'Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?\r\n'b'  Reynol. My Lord I haue\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. God buy you; fare you well\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. Good my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Obserue his inclination in your selfe\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. I shall my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. And let him plye his Musicke\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Reynol. Well, my Lord.\r\n'b'Enter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Ophelia.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Polon. Farewell:\r\n'b"How now Ophelia, what's the matter?\r\n"b'  Ophe. Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. With what, in the name of Heauen?\r\n'b'  Ophe. My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,\r\n'b"Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,\r\n"b"No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,\r\n"b'Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,\r\n'b'Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,\r\n'b'And with a looke so pitious in purport,\r\n'b'As if he had been loosed out of hell,\r\n'b'To speake of horrors: he comes before me\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Mad for thy Loue?\r\n'b'  Ophe. My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. What said he?\r\n'b'  Ophe. He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;\r\n'b'Then goes he to the length of all his arme;\r\n'b"And with his other hand thus o're his brow,\r\n"b'He fals to such perusall of my face,\r\n'b'As he would draw it. Long staid he so,\r\n'b'At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:\r\n'b'And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;\r\n'b"He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,\r\n"b'That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,\r\n'b'And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,\r\n'b"And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,\r\n"b"He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,\r\n"b'For out adores he went without their helpe;\r\n'b'And to the last, bended their light on me\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,\r\n'b'This is the very extasie of Loue,\r\n'b'Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,\r\n'b'And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,\r\n'b'As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,\r\n'b'That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,\r\n'b'What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?\r\n'b'  Ophe. No my good Lord: but as you did command,\r\n'b"I did repell his Letters, and deny'de\r\n"b'His accesse to me\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. That hath made him mad.\r\n'b'I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement\r\n'b'I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,\r\n'b'And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:\r\n'b'It seemes it is as proper to our Age,\r\n'b'To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,\r\n'b'As it is common for the yonger sort\r\n'b'To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,\r\n'b'This must be knowne, being kept close might moue\r\n'b'More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Scena Secunda.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guildensterne Cum alijs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne.\r\n'b'Moreouer, that we much did long to see you,\r\n'b'The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke\r\n'b'Our hastie sending. Something haue you heard\r\n'b'Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it,\r\n'b"Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man\r\n"b'Resembles that it was. What it should bee\r\n'b'More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him\r\n'b"So much from th' vnderstanding of himselfe,\r\n"b'I cannot deeme of. I intreat you both,\r\n'b'That being of so young dayes brought vp with him:\r\n'b"And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,\r\n"b'That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court\r\n'b'Some little time: so by your Companies\r\n'b'To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather\r\n'b'So much as from Occasions you may gleane,\r\n'b"That open'd lies within our remedie\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Qu. Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,\r\n"b'And sure I am, two men there are not liuing,\r\n'b'To whom he more adheres. If it will please you\r\n'b'To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good will,\r\n'b'As to expend your time with vs a-while,\r\n'b'For the supply and profit of our Hope,\r\n'b'Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes\r\n'b'As fits a Kings remembrance\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. Both your Maiesties\r\n'b'Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs,\r\n'b'Put your dread pleasures, more into Command\r\n'b'Then to Entreatie\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guil. We both obey,\r\n'b'And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,\r\n'b'To lay our Seruices freely at your feete,\r\n'b'To be commanded\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Guildensterne\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance.\r\n'b'And I beseech you instantly to visit\r\n'b'My too much changed Sonne.\r\n'b'Go some of ye,\r\n'b'And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guil. Heauens make our presence and our practises\r\n'b'Pleasant and helpfull to him.\r\n'b'Enter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Queene. Amen.\r\n'b'Enter Polonius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  Pol. Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord,\r\n"b"Are ioyfully return'd\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   King. Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Haue I, my Lord? Assure you, my good Liege,\r\n'b'I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,\r\n'b'Both to my God, one to my gracious King:\r\n'b'And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine\r\n'b'Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure\r\n'b"As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found\r\n"b'The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Pol. Giue first admittance to th' Ambassadors,\r\n"b'My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.\r\n'b'He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found\r\n'b'The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. I doubt it is no other, but the maine,\r\n'b"His Fathers death, and our o're-hasty Marriage.\r\n"b'Enter Polonius, Voltumand, and Cornelius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. Well, we shall sift him. Welcome good Frends:\r\n'b'Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey?\r\n'b'  Volt. Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.\r\n'b'Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse\r\n'b"His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd\r\n"b"To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:\r\n"b"But better look'd into, he truly found\r\n"b'It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,\r\n'b'That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence\r\n'b'Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests\r\n'b'On Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,\r\n'b'Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,\r\n'b'Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more\r\n'b"To giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie.\r\n"b'Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,\r\n'b'Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,\r\n'b'And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers\r\n'b'So leuied as before, against the Poleak:\r\n'b'With an intreaty heerein further shewne,\r\n'b'That it might please you to giue quiet passe\r\n'b'Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize,\r\n'b'On such regards of safety and allowance,\r\n'b'As therein are set downe\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. It likes vs well:\r\n'b"And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,\r\n"b'Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.\r\n'b'Meane time we thanke you, for your well-tooke Labour.\r\n'b"Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together.\r\n"b'Most welcome home.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit Ambass.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Pol. This businesse is very well ended.\r\n'b'My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate\r\n'b'What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,\r\n'b'Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,\r\n'b'Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.\r\n'b'Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,\r\n'b'And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,\r\n'b'I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad:\r\n'b'Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,\r\n'b"What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.\r\n"b'But let that go\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. More matter, with lesse Art\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:\r\n'b"That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,\r\n"b'And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,\r\n'b'But farewell it: for I will vse no Art.\r\n'b'Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines\r\n'b'That we finde out the cause of this effect,\r\n'b'Or rather say, the cause of this defect;\r\n'b'For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,\r\n'b'Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus. Perpend,\r\n'b"I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,\r\n"b'Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke,\r\n'b'Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The Letter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed Ophelia.\r\n'b"That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde\r\n"b'Phrase: but you shall heare these in her excellent white\r\n'b'bosome, these\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Came this from Hamlet to her\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.\r\n'b'Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,\r\n'b'Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:\r\n'b'Doubt Truth to be a Lier,\r\n'b'But neuer Doubt, I loue.\r\n'b'O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to\r\n'b'reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best beleeue\r\n'b'it. Adieu.\r\n'b'Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this\r\n'b'Machine is to him, Hamlet.\r\n'b"This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:\r\n"b'And more aboue hath his soliciting,\r\n'b'As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,\r\n'b'All giuen to mine eare\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   King. But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?\r\n"b'  Pol. What do you thinke of me?\r\n'b'  King. As of a man, faithfull and Honourable\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?\r\n'b'When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,\r\n'b'As I perceiued it, I must tell you that\r\n'b'Before my Daughter told me what might you\r\n'b'Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,\r\n'b'If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,\r\n'b'Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,\r\n'b"Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,\r\n"b'What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,\r\n'b'And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake\r\n'b'Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,\r\n'b'This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,\r\n'b'That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,\r\n'b'Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:\r\n'b'Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,\r\n'b'And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,\r\n'b'Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,\r\n'b'Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,\r\n'b'Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension\r\n'b'Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,\r\n'b'And all we waile for\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   King. Do you thinke 'tis this?\r\n"b'  Qu. It may be very likely\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Pol. Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,\r\n"b"That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,\r\n"b"When it prou'd otherwise?\r\n"b'  King. Not that I know\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Take this from this; if this be otherwise,\r\n'b'If Circumstances leade me, I will finde\r\n'b'Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede\r\n'b'Within the Center\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. How may we try it further?\r\n'b'  Pol. You know sometimes\r\n'b'He walkes foure houres together, heere\r\n'b'In the Lobby\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Qu. So he ha's indeed\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Pol. At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,\r\n'b'Be you and I behinde an Arras then,\r\n'b'Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,\r\n'b'And be not from his reason falne thereon;\r\n'b'Let me be no Assistant for a State,\r\n'b'And keepe a Farme and Carters\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. We will try it.\r\n'b'Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Qu. But looke where sadly the poore wretch\r\n'b'Comes reading\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Away I do beseech you, both away,\r\n'b'Ile boord him presently.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit King & Queen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Oh giue me leaue. How does my good Lord Hamlet?\r\n'b'  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Do you know me, my Lord?\r\n'b"  Ham. Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Not I my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Honest, my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee\r\n'b"one man pick'd out of two thousand\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Pol. That's very true, my Lord\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,\r\n'b'being a good kissing Carrion-\r\n'b'Haue you a daughter?\r\n'b'  Pol. I haue my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a\r\n"b'blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend\r\n'b"looke too't\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Pol. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter:\r\n'b'yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:\r\n'b'he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,\r\n'b'I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile\r\n'b'speake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Words, words, words\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. What is the matter, my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Betweene who?\r\n'b'  Pol. I meane the matter you meane, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,\r\n'b'that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;\r\n'b'their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree\r\n'b'Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,\r\n'b'together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I\r\n'b'most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it\r\n'b'not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your\r\n'b'selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could\r\n'b'go backward\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Though this be madnesse,\r\n'b"Yet there is Method in't: will you walke\r\n"b'Out of the ayre my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Into my Graue?\r\n'b"  Pol. Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:\r\n"b'How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?\r\n'b'A happinesse,\r\n'b'That often Madnesse hits on,\r\n'b'Which Reason and Sanitie could not\r\n'b"So prosperously be deliuer'd of.\r\n"b'I will leaue him,\r\n'b'And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting\r\n'b'Betweene him, and my daughter.\r\n'b'My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly\r\n'b'Take my leaue of you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I\r\n'b'will more willingly part withall, except my life, my\r\n'b'life\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. Fare you well my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. These tedious old fooles\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there\r\n'b'hee is.\r\n'b'Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Rosin. God saue you Sir\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Guild. Mine honour'd Lord?\r\n"b'  Rosin. My most deare Lord?\r\n'b"  Ham. My excellent good friends? How do'st thou\r\n"b'Guildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye\r\n'b'both?\r\n'b'  Rosin. As the indifferent Children of the earth\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes\r\n'b'Cap, we are not the very Button\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Nor the Soales of her Shoo?\r\n'b'  Rosin. Neither my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle\r\n'b'of her fauour?\r\n'b'  Guil. Faith, her priuates, we\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:\r\n'b"she is a Strumpet. What's the newes?\r\n"b"  Rosin. None my Lord; but that the World's growne\r\n"b'honest\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is\r\n'b'not true. Let me question more in particular: what haue\r\n'b'you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,\r\n'b'that she sends you to Prison hither?\r\n'b'  Guil. Prison, my Lord?\r\n'b"  Ham. Denmark's a Prison\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. Then is the World one\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,\r\n'b"Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'\r\n"b'worst\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing\r\n"b'either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is\r\n'b'a prison\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis\r\n"b'too narrow for your minde\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and\r\n'b'count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that\r\n'b'I haue bad dreames\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the\r\n'b'very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow\r\n'b'of a Dreame\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and\r\n'b'light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs\r\n'b'and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:\r\n'b"shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?\r\n"b"  Both. Wee'l wait vpon you\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the\r\n'b'rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest\r\n'b'man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten\r\n'b'way of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?\r\n'b'  Rosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;\r\n'b'but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks\r\n'b'are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it\r\n'b'your owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\r\n'b'deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guil. What should we say my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were\r\n'b'sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;\r\n'b'which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,\r\n'b'I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. To what end my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. That you must teach me: but let mee coniure\r\n'b'you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\r\n'b'our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,\r\n'b'and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge\r\n'b'you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you\r\n'b'were sent for or no\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. What say you?\r\n'b'  Ham. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me\r\n'b'hold not off\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guil. My Lord, we were sent for\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\r\n'b'preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and\r\n'b'Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore\r\n'b'I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;\r\n'b'and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;\r\n'b'that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill\r\n'b'Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,\r\n'b'look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,\r\n'b'fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing\r\n'b'to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.\r\n'b'What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in\r\n'b'Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing\r\n'b'how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?\r\n'b'in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the\r\n'b'world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is\r\n'b'this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,\r\n'b'nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme\r\n'b'to say so\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my\r\n'b'thoughts\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights\r\n'b'not me?\r\n'b'  Rosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,\r\n'b'what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue\r\n'b'from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are\r\n'b'they comming to offer you Seruice\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; his\r\n'b'Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous\r\n'b'Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall\r\n'b'not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in\r\n'b'peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs\r\n'b"are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde\r\n"b"freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players\r\n"b'are they?\r\n'b'  Rosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight in\r\n'b'the Tragedians of the City\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residence\r\n'b'both in reputation and profit was better both\r\n'b'wayes\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes\r\n'b'of the late Innouation?\r\n'b'  Ham. Doe they hold the same estimation they did\r\n'b"when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?\r\n"b'  Rosin. No indeed, they are not\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?\r\n'b'  Rosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted\r\n'b'pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little\r\n'b'Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and\r\n'b"are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the\r\n"b'fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they\r\n'b'call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of\r\n'b'Goose-quils, and dare scarse come thither\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?\r\n"b'How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no\r\n'b'longer then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards\r\n'b'if they should grow themselues to common Players (as\r\n'b'it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers\r\n'b'do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their\r\n'b'owne Succession\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:\r\n"b'and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.\r\n'b'There was for a while, no mony bid for argument,\r\n'b'vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in\r\n'b'the Question\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Is't possible?\r\n"b"  Guild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of\r\n"b'Braines\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?\r\n'b'  Rosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of\r\n'b'Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him\r\n'b'while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred\r\n'b'Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is something\r\n'b'in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could\r\n'b'finde it out.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Flourish for the Players.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Guil. There are the Players\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your\r\n'b'hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion\r\n'b'and Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,\r\n'b'lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew\r\n'b'fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment\r\n'b'then yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,\r\n'b"and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Guil. In what my deere Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. I am but mad North, North-West: when the\r\n'b'Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.\r\n'b'Enter Polonius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Pol. Well be with you Gentlemen\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each\r\n'b'eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet\r\n'b'out of his swathing clouts\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Rosin. Happily he's the second time come to them: for\r\n"b'they say, an old man is twice a childe\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the\r\n'b'Players. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning\r\n'b"'twas so indeed\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Pol. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.\r\n'b'When Rossius an Actor in Rome-\r\n'b'  Pol. The Actors are come hither my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Buzze, buzze\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Vpon mine Honor\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Then can each Actor on his Asse-\r\n'b'  Polon. The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,\r\n'b'Comedie, Historie, Pastorall:\r\n'b'Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:\r\n'b'Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:\r\n'b'Scene indiuidible: or Poem\r\n'b'vnlimited. Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus\r\n'b'too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are\r\n'b'the onely men\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st\r\n"b'thou?\r\n'b'  Pol. What a Treasure had he, my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Why one faire Daughter, and no more,\r\n'b'The which he loued passing well\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Still on my Daughter\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?\r\n"b'  Polon. If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter\r\n'b'that I loue passing well\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Nay that followes not\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. What followes then, my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ha. Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It\r\n'b'came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the\r\n'b'Pons Chanson will shew you more. For looke where my\r\n'b'Abridgements come.\r\n'b'Enter foure or fiue Players.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see\r\n"b'thee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend?\r\n'b"Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to\r\n"b'beard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris?\r\n'b'Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when\r\n'b'I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God\r\n'b"your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd\r\n"b"within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne\r\n"b"to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l\r\n"b'haue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality:\r\n'b'come, a passionate speech\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   1.Play. What speech, my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was\r\n'b'neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I\r\n'b"remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the\r\n"b"Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose\r\n"b'iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an\r\n'b'excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe\r\n'b'with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,\r\n'b'there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;\r\n'b'nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the\r\n'b"Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One\r\n"b"cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale\r\n"b'to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks\r\n'b'of Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at\r\n'b'this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like\r\n'b"th'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus\r\n"b'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes\r\n'b'Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble\r\n'b'When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,\r\n'b"Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd\r\n"b'With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote\r\n'b"Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd\r\n"b'With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,\r\n'b"Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\r\n"b'That lend a tyrannous, and damned light\r\n'b'To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,\r\n'b"And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,\r\n"b'With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\r\n'b'Olde Grandsire Priam seekes\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,\r\n'b'and good discretion\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   1.Player. Anon he findes him,\r\n'b'Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,\r\n'b'Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles\r\n'b'Repugnant to command: vnequall match,\r\n'b'Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:\r\n'b'But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,\r\n'b"Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,\r\n"b'Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top\r\n'b'Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash\r\n'b'Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword\r\n'b'Which was declining on the Milkie head\r\n'b"Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:\r\n"b'So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,\r\n'b'And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.\r\n'b'But as we often see against some storme,\r\n'b'A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,\r\n'b'The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below\r\n'b'As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder\r\n'b'Doth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,\r\n'b'A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,\r\n'b'And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall\r\n'b"On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,\r\n"b'With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword\r\n'b'Now falles on Priam.\r\n'b'Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,\r\n'b'In generall Synod take away her power:\r\n'b'Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,\r\n'b'And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,\r\n'b'As low as to the Fiends\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. This is too long\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee\r\n"b"say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee\r\n"b'sleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. The inobled Queene?\r\n'b"  Pol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,\r\n'b'Threatning the flame\r\n'b'With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,\r\n'b'Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe\r\n'b'About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,\r\n'b"A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.\r\n"b"Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,\r\n"b"'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?\r\n"b'But if the Gods themselues did see her then,\r\n'b'When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\r\n'b'In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,\r\n'b'The instant Burst of Clamour that she made\r\n'b'(Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)\r\n'b'Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,\r\n'b'And passion in the Gods\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and\r\n"b"ha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Ham. 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,\r\n"b"soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.\r\n"b"Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are\r\n"b'the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After\r\n'b'your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then\r\n'b'their ill report while you liued\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man\r\n'b'after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse\r\n'b'them after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they\r\n'b'deserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them\r\n'b'in\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Come sirs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit Polon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  Ham.

I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.\r\n"b'Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?\r\n'b'Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,\r\n'b'But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,\r\n'b'Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,\r\n'b"That from her working, all his visage warm'd;\r\n"b"Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,\r\n"b'A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting\r\n'b'With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?\r\n'b'For Hecuba?\r\n'b"What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\r\n"b'That he should weepe for her? What would he doe,\r\n'b'Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion\r\n'b'That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,\r\n'b'And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:\r\n'b'Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,\r\n'b'Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,\r\n'b'The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,\r\n'b'A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake\r\n'b'Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,\r\n'b'And can say nothing: No, not for a King,\r\n'b'Vpon whose property, and most deere life,\r\n'b"A damn'd defeate was made.

The Spirit that I haue seene\r\n'b'May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power\r\n'b"T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps\r\n"b'Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,\r\n'b'As he is very potent with such Spirits,\r\n'b'Abuses me to damne me.

And can you by no drift of circumstance\r\n'b'Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:\r\n'b'Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet\r\n'b'With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,\r\n'b'But from what cause he will by no meanes speake\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guil. Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,\r\n'b'But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:\r\n'b'When we would bring him on to some Confession\r\n'b'Of his true state\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu.

Niggard of question, but of our demands\r\n'b'Most free in his reply\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Did you assay him to any pastime?\r\n'b'  Rosin. Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players\r\n'b'We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,\r\n'b'And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy\r\n'b'To heare of it: They are about the Court,\r\n'b'And (as I thinke) they haue already order\r\n'b'This night to play before him\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Pol.

We shall my Lord.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,\r\n'b'For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,\r\n'b"That he, as 'twere by accident, may there\r\n"b'Affront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)\r\n'b'Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene\r\n'b'We may of their encounter frankely iudge,\r\n'b'And gather by him, as he is behaued,\r\n'b"If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.\r\n"b'That thus he suffers for\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. I shall obey you,\r\n'b'And for your part Ophelia, I do wish\r\n'b'That your good Beauties be the happy cause\r\n'b'Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues\r\n'b'Will bring him to his wonted way againe,\r\n'b'To both your Honors\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. Madam, I wish it may\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Pol. Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye\r\n'b'We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,\r\n'b'That shew of such an exercise may colour\r\n'b'Your lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,\r\n'b"'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,\r\n"b"And pious Action, we do surge o're\r\n"b'The diuell himselfe\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   King. Oh 'tis true:\r\n"b'How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?\r\n'b"The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art\r\n"b'Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,\r\n'b'Then is my deede, to my most painted word.\r\n'b'Oh heauie burthen!\r\n'b"  Pol. I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.\r\n"b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Hamlet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the Question:\r\n'b"Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer\r\n"b'The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,\r\n'b'Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,\r\n'b'And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe\r\n'b'No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end\r\n'b'The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes\r\n'b"That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation\r\n"b"Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,\r\n"b"To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,\r\n"b'For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,\r\n'b"When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,\r\n"b"Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect\r\n"b'That makes Calamity of so long life:\r\n'b'For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,\r\n'b'The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,\r\n'b"The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,\r\n"b'The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes\r\n'b'That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,\r\n'b'When he himselfe might his Quietus make\r\n'b'With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare\r\n'b'To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,\r\n'b'But that the dread of something after death,\r\n'b'The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne\r\n'b'No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,\r\n'b'And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,\r\n'b'Then flye to others that we know not of.\r\n'b'Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,\r\n'b'And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution\r\n'b"Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,\r\n"b'And enterprizes of great pith and moment,\r\n'b'With this regard their Currants turne away,\r\n'b'And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,\r\n'b'The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons\r\n'b'Be all my sinnes remembred\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. Good my Lord,\r\n'b'How does your Honor for this many a day?\r\n'b'  Ham. I humbly thanke you: well, well, well\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,\r\n'b'That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.\r\n'b'I pray you now, receiue them\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. No, no, I neuer gaue you ought\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ophe. My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,\r\n"b"And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,\r\n"b'As made the things more rich, then perfume left:\r\n'b'Take these againe, for to the Noble minde\r\n'b'Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.\r\n'b'There my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Ha, ha: Are you honest?\r\n'b'  Ophe. My Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Are you faire?\r\n'b'  Ophe. What meanes your Lordship?\r\n'b'  Ham. That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty\r\n'b'should admit no discourse to your Beautie\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce\r\n'b'then your Honestie?\r\n'b'  Ham. I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner\r\n'b'transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the\r\n'b'force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.\r\n'b'This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it\r\n'b'proofe. I did loue you once\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue\r\n'b'cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish\r\n'b'of it. I loued you not\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. I was the more deceiued\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou\r\n"b'be a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,\r\n'b'but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better\r\n'b'my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,\r\n'b'Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,\r\n'b'then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue\r\n'b'them shape, or time to acte them in. What should such\r\n'b'Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.\r\n'b'We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy\r\n'b"wayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?\r\n"b'  Ophe. At home, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may\r\n'b"play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. O helpe him, you sweet Heauens\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague\r\n'b'for thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,\r\n'b'thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.\r\n'b'Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:\r\n'b'for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you\r\n'b'make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. O heauenly Powers, restore him\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.\r\n'b'God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:\r\n'b'you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname\r\n'b'Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.\r\n'b"Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.\r\n"b'I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are\r\n'b'married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep\r\n'b'as they are. To a Nunnery, go.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit Hamlet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  Ophe. O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?\r\n"b'The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,\r\n'b"Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,\r\n"b'The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,\r\n'b"Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.\r\n"b'Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,\r\n'b"That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:\r\n"b'Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,\r\n'b'Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,\r\n'b"That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,\r\n"b'Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,\r\n'b"T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.\r\n"b'Enter King, and Polonius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. Loue? His affections do not that way tend,\r\n'b"Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,\r\n"b"Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?\r\n"b"O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,\r\n"b'And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose\r\n'b'Will be some danger, which to preuent\r\n'b'I haue in quicke determination\r\n'b'Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England\r\n'b'For the demand of our neglected Tribute:\r\n'b'Haply the Seas and Countries different\r\n'b'With variable Obiects, shall expell\r\n'b'This something setled matter in his heart:\r\n'b'Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus\r\n'b"From fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't?\r\n"b'  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I beleeue\r\n'b'The Origin and Commencement of this greefe\r\n'b'Sprung from neglected loue. How now Ophelia?\r\n'b'You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,\r\n'b'We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,\r\n'b'But if you hold it fit after the Play,\r\n'b'Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him\r\n'b'To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,\r\n'b"And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare\r\n"b'Of all their Conference. If she finde him not,\r\n'b'To England send him: Or confine him where\r\n'b'Your wisedome best shall thinke\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. It shall be so:\r\n'b"Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.\r\n"b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  Ham. Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd\r\n"b'it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,\r\n'b'as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer\r\n'b'had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much\r\n'b'your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,\r\n'b'Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of\r\n'b'Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that\r\n'b'may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule,\r\n'b'to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion\r\n'b'to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the\r\n'b'Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of\r\n'b'nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could\r\n'b"haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it\r\n"b"outHerod's Herod. Pray you auoid it\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Player. I warrant your Honor\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne\r\n'b'Discretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word,\r\n'b'the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:\r\n'b'That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any\r\n'b'thing so ouer-done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whose\r\n'b"end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer\r\n"b'the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne\r\n'b'Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and\r\n'b'Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this\r\n'b'ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull\r\n'b'laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The\r\n'b"censure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway\r\n"b'a whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players\r\n'b'that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that\r\n'b'highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing\r\n'b'the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,\r\n'b'or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue\r\n'b'thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,\r\n'b'and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Play. I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with\r\n"b'vs, Sir\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. O reforme it altogether. And let those that\r\n'b'play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for\r\n'b'them. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,\r\n'b'to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh\r\n'b'too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question\r\n'b"of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &\r\n"b'shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses\r\n'b'it. Go make you readie.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit Players.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'How now my Lord,\r\n'b'Will the King heare this peece of Worke?\r\n'b'  Pol. And the Queene too, and that presently\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Bid the Players make hast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit Polonius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Will you two helpe to hasten them?\r\n'b'  Both. We will my Lord.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Horatio.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. What hoa, Horatio?\r\n'b'  Hora. Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Horatio, thou art eene as iust a man\r\n'b"As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Hora. O my deere Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Nay, do not thinke I flatter:\r\n'b'For what aduancement may I hope from thee,\r\n'b'That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits\r\n'b"To feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd?\r\n"b'No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,\r\n'b'And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,\r\n'b'Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare,\r\n'b'Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,\r\n'b'And could of men distinguish, her election\r\n'b"Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene\r\n"b'As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.\r\n'b'A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards\r\n'b"Hath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those,\r\n"b'Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled,\r\n'b'That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.\r\n'b'To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man,\r\n'b'That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him\r\n'b'In my hearts Core. I, in my Heart of heart,\r\n'b'As I do thee. Something too much of this.\r\n'b'There is a Play to night to before the King.\r\n'b'One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance\r\n'b'Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.\r\n'b"I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,\r\n"b'Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule\r\n'b'Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,\r\n'b'Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,\r\n'b'It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:\r\n'b'And my Imaginations are as foule\r\n'b'As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,\r\n'b'For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:\r\n'b'And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,\r\n'b'To censure of his seeming\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hora. Well my Lord.\r\n'b"If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,\r\n"b'And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.\r\n'b'Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,\r\n'b'Guildensterne, and\r\n'b'other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches. Danish\r\n'b'March. Sound\r\n'b'a Flourish.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. They are comming to the Play: I must be idle.\r\n'b'Get you a place\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. How fares our Cosin Hamlet?\r\n'b'  Ham. Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate\r\n'b"the Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   King. I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, these\r\n'b'words are not mine\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you plaid once\r\n'b"i'th' Vniuersity, you say?\r\n"b'  Polon. That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good\r\n'b'Actor\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. And what did you enact?\r\n'b"  Pol. I did enact Iulius Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:\r\n"b"Brutus kill'd me\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a\r\n'b'Calfe there. Be the Players ready?\r\n'b'  Rosin. I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ha.

I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?\r\n'b'  Ophe. I my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Do you thinke I meant Country matters?\r\n'b'  Ophe. I thinke nothing, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs\r\n"b'  Ophe. What is my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Nothing\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. You are merrie, my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Who I?\r\n'b'  Ophe. I my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what should\r\n'b'a man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheerefully\r\n'b"my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two\r\n"b'Houres\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ophe. Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke,\r\n'b'for Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two moneths\r\n'b"ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, a\r\n"b'great mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare:\r\n'b'But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall\r\n'b'he suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose\r\n'b'Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Hoboyes play.

Anon comes in a Fellow,\r\n'b'takes off his\r\n'b'Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, and\r\n'b'Exits. The\r\n'b'Queene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionate\r\n'b'Action. The\r\n'b'Poysoner, with some two or three Mutes comes in againe, seeming\r\n'b'to lament\r\n'b'with her. The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the\r\n'b'Queene with\r\n'b'Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end,\r\n'b'accepts his\r\n'b'loue.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ophe.

Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?\r\n'b"  Ophe. 'Tis briefe my Lord\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. As Womans loue.\r\n'b'Enter King and his Queene.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,\r\n'b'Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground:\r\n'b'And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,\r\n'b'About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,\r\n'b'Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our hands\r\n'b'Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Bap.

I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak:\r\n'b'But what we do determine, oft we breake:\r\n'b'Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,\r\n'b'Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:\r\n'b'Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,\r\n'b'But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.\r\n'b"Most necessary 'tis, that we forget\r\n"b'To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:\r\n'b'What to our selues in passion we propose,\r\n'b'The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.\r\n'b'The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,\r\n'b'Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:\r\n'b'Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;\r\n'b'Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.\r\n'b"This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange\r\n"b'That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.\r\n'b"For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,\r\n"b'Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.\r\n'b'The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,\r\n'b"The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:\r\n"b'And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,\r\n'b'For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:\r\n'b'And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,\r\n'b'Directly seasons him his Enemie.\r\n'b'But orderly to end, where I begun,\r\n'b'Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run,\r\n'b'That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,\r\n'b'Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.\r\n'b'So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.\r\n'b'But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Bap. Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,\r\n'b'Sport and repose locke from me day and night:\r\n'b'Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,\r\n'b'Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:\r\n'b'Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,\r\n'b'If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. If she should breake it now\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   King. 'Tis deepely sworne:\r\n"b'Sweet, leaue me heere a while,\r\n'b'My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile\r\n'b'The tedious day with sleepe\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Sleepe rocke thy Braine,\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Sleepes\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. Madam, how like you this Play?\r\n'b'  Qu. The Lady protests to much me thinkes\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Oh but shee'l keepe her word\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   King. Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offence\r\n'b"in't?\r\n"b'  Ham. No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Offence\r\n'b"i'th' world\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   King. What do you call the Play?\r\n'b'  Ham. The Mouse-trap: Marry how? Tropically:\r\n'b'This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago\r\n'b'is the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall see\r\n'b"anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?\r\n"b'Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches\r\n'b"vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.\r\n"b'Enter Lucianus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This is one Lucianus nephew to the King\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. You are a good Chorus, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I could interpret betweene you and your loue:\r\n'b'if I could see the Puppets dallying\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. You are keene my Lord, you are keene\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. It would cost you a groaning, to take off my\r\n'b'edge\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. Still better and worse\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. So you mistake Husbands.\r\n'b'Begin Murderer. Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and\r\n'b'begin. Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Lucian. Thoughts blacke, hands apt,\r\n'b'Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:\r\n'b'Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:\r\n'b'Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,\r\n'b'With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,\r\n'b'Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,\r\n'b'On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Powres the poyson in his eares.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  Ham. He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His\r\n"b"name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyce\r\n"b'Italian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the\r\n'b"loue of Gonzago's wife\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ophe. The King rises\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. What, frighted with false fire\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. How fares my Lord?\r\n'b"  Pol. Giue o're the Play\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   King. Giue me some Light. Away\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   All. Lights, Lights, Lights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Manet Hamlet & Horatio.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. Why let the strucken Deere go weepe,\r\n'b'The Hart vngalled play:\r\n'b'For some must watch, while some must sleepe;\r\n'b'So runnes the world away.\r\n'b'Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of\r\n'b'my Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall\r\n'b"Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie\r\n"b'of Players sir\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Halfe a share\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. A whole one I,\r\n'b'For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere,\r\n'b'This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe,\r\n'b'And now reignes heere.\r\n'b'A verie verie Paiocke\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hora. You might haue Rim'd\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for\r\n'b"a thousand pound. Did'st perceiue?\r\n"b'  Hora. Verie well my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Vpon the talke of the poysoning?\r\n'b'  Hora. I did verie well note him.\r\n'b'Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. Oh, ha? Come some Musick. Come y Recorders:\r\n'b'For if the King like not the Comedie,\r\n'b'Why then belike he likes it not perdie.\r\n'b'Come some Musicke\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Sir, a whole History\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. The King, sir\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I sir, what of him?\r\n'b"  Guild. Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. With drinke Sir?\r\n'b'  Guild. No my Lord, rather with choller\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer,\r\n'b'to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him\r\n'b'to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre\r\n'b'more Choller\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. Good my Lord put your discourse into some\r\n'b'frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I am tame Sir, pronounce\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. The Queene your Mother, in most great affliction\r\n'b'of spirit, hath sent me to you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. You are welcome\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of\r\n'b'the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholsome\r\n'b"answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:\r\n"b'if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end of\r\n'b'my Businesse\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Sir, I cannot\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. What, my Lord?\r\n'b"  Ham. Make you a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd.\r\n"b'But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal command:\r\n'b'or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no more\r\n'b'but to the matter. My Mother you say\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath stroke\r\n'b'her into amazement, and admiration\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a\r\n'b'Mother. But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers\r\n'b'admiration?\r\n'b'  Rosin. She desires to speake with you in her Closset,\r\n'b'ere you go to bed\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.\r\n'b'Haue you any further Trade with vs?\r\n'b'  Rosin. My Lord, you once did loue me\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. So I do still, by these pickers and stealers\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper?\r\n'b'You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie,\r\n'b'if you deny your greefes to your Friend\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Sir I lacke Aduancement\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. How can that be, when you haue the voyce of\r\n'b'the King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke?\r\n'b'  Ham. I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe is\r\n'b'something musty.\r\n'b'Enter one with a Recorder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with you, why\r\n'b'do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if you\r\n'b'would driue me into a toyle?\r\n'b'  Guild. O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loue\r\n'b'is too vnmannerly\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I do not well vnderstand that. Will you play\r\n'b'vpon this Pipe?\r\n'b'  Guild. My Lord, I cannot\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I pray you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. Beleeue me, I cannot\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I do beseech you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. I know no touch of it, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. 'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges\r\n"b'with your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your\r\n'b'mouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke.\r\n'b'Looke you, these are the stoppes\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. But these cannot I command to any vtterance\r\n'b'of hermony, I haue not the skill\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing\r\n'b'you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would\r\n'b'seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart\r\n'b'of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest\r\n'b'Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke,\r\n'b'excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot\r\n'b'you make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee\r\n'b'plaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,\r\n'b'though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me. God\r\n'b'blesse you Sir.\r\n'b'Enter Polonius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Polon. My Lord; the Queene would speak with you,\r\n'b'and presently\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shape\r\n"b'like a Camell\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Polon. By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Me thinkes it is like a Weazell\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Polon. It is back'd like a Weazell\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Or like a Whale?\r\n'b'  Polon. Verie like a Whale\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:\r\n'b'They foole me to the top of my bent.\r\n'b'I will come by and by\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Polon. I will say so.\r\n'b'Enter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. By and by, is easily said. Leaue me Friends:\r\n'b"'Tis now the verie witching time of night,\r\n"b'When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths out\r\n'b'Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,\r\n'b'And do such bitter businesse as the day\r\n'b'Would quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother:\r\n'b'Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer\r\n'b'The Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome:\r\n'b'Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,\r\n'b'I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:\r\n'b'My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.\r\n'b'How in my words someuer she be shent,\r\n'b'To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.\r\n'b'Enter King, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,\r\n'b'To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you,\r\n'b'I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,\r\n'b'And he to England shall along with you:\r\n'b'The termes of our estate, may not endure\r\n'b'Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow\r\n'b'Out of his Lunacies\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Guild. We will our selues prouide:\r\n'b'Most holie and Religious feare it is\r\n'b'To keepe those many many bodies safe\r\n'b'That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. The single\r\n'b'And peculiar life is bound\r\n'b'With all the strength and Armour of the minde,\r\n'b'To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,\r\n'b'That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests\r\n'b'The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie\r\n'b'Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw\r\n'b"What's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheele\r\n"b'Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount.\r\n'b'To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things\r\n'b"Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,\r\n"b'Each small annexment, pettie consequence\r\n'b'Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone\r\n'b'Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;\r\n'b'For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,\r\n'b'Which now goes too free-footed\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Both. We will haste vs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt. Gent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Polonius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  Pol. My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:\r\n"b'Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe\r\n'b"To heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,\r\n"b'And as you said, and wisely was it said,\r\n'b"'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,\r\n"b"Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heare\r\n"b'The speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege,\r\n'b'Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,\r\n'b'And tell you what I know\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Thankes deere my Lord.\r\n'b'Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,\r\n'b"It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,\r\n"b'A Brothers murther. Pray can I not,\r\n'b'Though inclination be as sharpe as will:\r\n'b'My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,\r\n'b'And like a man to double businesse bound,\r\n'b'I stand in pause where I shall first begin,\r\n'b'And both neglect; what if this cursed hand\r\n'b'Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,\r\n'b'Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens\r\n'b'To wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy,\r\n'b'But to confront the visage of Offence?\r\n'b"And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force,\r\n"b'To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,\r\n'b"Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp,\r\n"b'My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer\r\n'b'Can serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:\r\n'b'That cannot be, since I am still possest\r\n'b'Of those effects for which I did the Murther.\r\n'b'My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:\r\n'b"May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?\r\n"b'In the corrupted currants of this world,\r\n'b'Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,\r\n'b"And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe\r\n"b"Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,\r\n"b'There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes\r\n'b"In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd\r\n"b'Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\r\n'b'To giue in euidence.

Rebellious Hell,\r\n'b'If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,\r\n'b'To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.\r\n'b'And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,\r\n'b'When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,\r\n'b'Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,\r\n'b'As Reason panders Will\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu.

Oh speake to me, no more,\r\n'b'These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.\r\n'b'No more sweet Hamlet\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. A Murderer, and a Villaine:\r\n'b'A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe\r\n'b'Of your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings,\r\n'b'A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.\r\n'b'That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,\r\n'b'And put it in his Pocket\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. No more.\r\n'b'Enter Ghost.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. A King of shreds and patches.\r\n'b"Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings\r\n"b'You heauenly Guards. What would your gracious figure?\r\n'b"  Qu. Alas he's mad\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,\r\n'b"That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by\r\n"b"Th' important acting of your dread command? Oh say\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ghost. Do not forget: this Visitation\r\n'b'Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\r\n'b'But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;\r\n'b'O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,\r\n'b'Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.\r\n'b'Speake to her Hamlet\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. How is it with you Lady?\r\n'b"  Qu. Alas, how is't with you?\r\n"b'That you bend your eye on vacancie,\r\n'b'And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.\r\n'b'Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,\r\n'b"And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,\r\n"b'Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,\r\n'b'Start vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne,\r\n'b'Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper\r\n'b'Sprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?\r\n'b'  Ham. On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,\r\n'b"His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,\r\n"b'Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,\r\n'b'Least with this pitteous action you conuert\r\n'b'My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,\r\n'b'Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. To who do you speake this?\r\n'b'  Ham. Do you see nothing there?\r\n'b'  Qu. Nothing at all, yet all that is I see\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Nor did you nothing heare?\r\n'b'  Qu.

This is the very coynage of your Braine,\r\n'b'This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Extasie?\r\n'b'My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,\r\n'b'And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse\r\n'b'That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test\r\n'b'And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse\r\n'b'Would gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace,\r\n'b'Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,\r\n'b'That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:\r\n'b'It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,\r\n'b"Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,\r\n"b'Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,\r\n'b"Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come,\r\n"b'And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,\r\n'b'To make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue,\r\n'b'For in the fatnesse of this pursie times,\r\n'b'Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,\r\n'b'Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Oh Hamlet,\r\n'b'Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. O throw away the worser part of it,\r\n'b'And liue the purer with the other halfe.\r\n'b'Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,\r\n'b'Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,\r\n'b'And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse\r\n'b'To the next abstinence.

What shall I do?\r\n'b'  Ham. Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:\r\n'b'Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,\r\n'b'Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,\r\n'b'And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,\r\n'b"Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,\r\n"b'Make you to rauell all this matter out,\r\n'b'That I essentially am not in madnesse,\r\n'b"But made in craft.

Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. This man shall set me packing:\r\n'b'Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome,\r\n'b'Mother goodnight. Indeede this Counsellor\r\n'b'Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,\r\n'b'Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue.\r\n'b'Come sir, to draw toward an end with you.\r\n'b'Good night Mother.\r\n'b'Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter King.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  King.

Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night?\r\n'b"  King. What Gertrude? How do's Hamlet?\r\n"b'  Qu. Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend\r\n'b'Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit\r\n'b'Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,\r\n'b'He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,\r\n'b'And in his brainish apprehension killes\r\n'b'The vnseene good old man\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Oh heauy deed:\r\n'b'It had bin so with vs had we beene there:\r\n'b'His Liberty is full of threats to all,\r\n'b'To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one.\r\n'b'Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?\r\n'b'It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence\r\n'b"Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,\r\n"b'This mad yong man. But so much was our loue,\r\n'b'We would not vnderstand what was most fit,\r\n'b'But like the Owner of a foule disease,\r\n'b"To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede\r\n"b'Euen on the pith of life. Where is he gone?\r\n'b'  Qu. To draw apart the body he hath kild,\r\n'b"O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare\r\n"b'Among a Minerall of Mettels base\r\n'b'Shewes it selfe pure. He weepes for what is done\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Oh Gertrude, come away:\r\n'b'The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch,\r\n'b'But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,\r\n'b'We must with all our Maiesty and Skill\r\n'b'Both countenance, and excuse.\r\n'b'Enter Ros. & Guild.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ho Guildenstern:\r\n'b'Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde:\r\n'b'Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine,\r\n'b"And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.\r\n"b'Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body\r\n'b'Into the Chappell. I pray you hast in this.\r\n'b'Exit Gent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"Come Gertrude, wee'l call vp our wisest friends,\r\n"b'To let them know both what we meane to do,\r\n'b"And what's vntimely done. Oh come away,\r\n"b'My soule is full of discord and dismay.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Hamlet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ham. Safely stowed\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Gentlemen within.

What haue you done my Lord with the dead body?\r\n'b"  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Rosin. Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,\r\n"b'And beare it to the Chappell\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Do not beleeue it\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. Beleeue what?\r\n'b'  Ham. That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine\r\n'b'owne. Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what replication\r\n'b'should be made by the Sonne of a King\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance, his\r\n'b'Rewards, his Authorities (but such Officers do the King\r\n'b'best seruice in the end. He keepes them like an Ape in\r\n'b"the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be last swallowed,\r\n"b"when he needes what you haue glean'd, it is but squeezing\r\n"b'you, and Spundge you shall be dry againe\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. I vnderstand you not my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a\r\n'b'foolish eare\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is,\r\n'b'and go with vs to the King\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not\r\n'b'with the body. The King, is a thing-\r\n'b'  Guild. A thing my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all\r\n'b'after.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter King.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King.

Without my Lord, guarded to know your\r\n'b'pleasure\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Bring him before vs\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Rosin. Hoa, Guildensterne?

Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a certaine\r\n'b"conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him. Your worm\r\n"b'is your onely Emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else\r\n'b'to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots. Your fat King,\r\n'b'and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes,\r\n'b"but to one Table that's the end\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   King. What dost thou meane by this?\r\n'b'  Ham. Nothing but to shew you how a King may go\r\n'b'a Progresse through the guts of a Begger\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Where is Polonius\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. In heauen, send thither to see. If your Messenger\r\n'b"finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place your\r\n"b'selfe: but indeed, if you finde him not this moneth, you\r\n'b'shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Go seeke him there\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. He will stay till ye come\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   K. Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety\r\n'b'Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue\r\n'b'For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence\r\n'b'With fierie Quicknesse. Therefore prepare thy selfe,\r\n'b'The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe,\r\n'b"Th' Associates tend, and euery thing at bent\r\n"b'For England\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. For England?\r\n'b'  King.

Farewell deere Mother\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Thy louing Father Hamlet\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hamlet. My Mother: Father and Mother is man and\r\n'b'wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother. Come,\r\n'b'for England.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. Follow him at foote,\r\n'b'Tempt him with speed aboord:\r\n'b'Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night.\r\n'b"Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done\r\n"b"That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray you make hast.\r\n"b'And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,\r\n'b'As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,\r\n'b'Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red\r\n'b'After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe\r\n'b'Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set\r\n'b'Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full\r\n'b'By Letters coniuring to that effect\r\n'b'The present death of Hamlet. Do it England,\r\n'b'For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,\r\n'b"And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,\r\n"b"How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun.\r\n"b'\r\n'b'Exit\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Fortinbras with an Armie.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  For. Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,\r\n'b'Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras\r\n'b"Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March\r\n"b'Ouer his Kingdome. You know the Rendeuous:\r\n'b'If that his Maiesty would ought with vs,\r\n'b'We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,\r\n'b'And let him know so\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Cap.

She is importunate, indeed distract, her moode\r\n'b'will needs be pittied\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. What would she haue?\r\n'b'  Hor. She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares\r\n'b"There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,\r\n"b'Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt,\r\n'b'That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,\r\n'b'Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue\r\n'b'The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,\r\n'b'And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,\r\n'b'Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them,\r\n'b'Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,\r\n'b'Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Qu. 'Twere good she were spoken with,\r\n"b'For she may strew dangerous coniectures\r\n'b'In ill breeding minds. Let her come in.\r\n'b'To my sicke soule (as sinnes true Nature is)\r\n'b'Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse,\r\n'b'So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt,\r\n'b"It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.\r\n"b'Enter Ophelia distracted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Ophe.

They say the Owle was\r\n"b'a Bakers daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but\r\n'b'know not what we may be. God be at your Table\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Conceit vpon her Father\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ophe.

How long hath she bin thus?\r\n'b'  Ophe. I hope all will be well. We must bee patient,\r\n'b'but I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should\r\n'b"lay him i'th' cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it,\r\n"b'and so I thanke you for your good counsell.

Poore Ophelia\r\n'b'Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement,\r\n'b'Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts.\r\n'b'Last, and as much containing as all these,\r\n'b'Her Brother is in secret come from France,\r\n'b'Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds,\r\n'b'And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare\r\n'b'With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,\r\n'b'Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,\r\n'b'Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne\r\n'b'In eare and eare.

What are they that would speake with me?\r\n'b'  Ser. Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Let them come in,\r\n'b'I do not know from what part of the world\r\n'b'I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.\r\n'b'Enter Saylor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Say. God blesse you Sir\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Let him blesse thee too\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Say. Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter\r\n"b"for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was\r\n"b'bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let\r\n'b'to know it is.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Reads the Letter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"Horatio, When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these\r\n"b'Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters\r\n'b'for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very\r\n'b'Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues too\r\n'b'slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, I\r\n'b'boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so\r\n'b'I alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, like\r\n'b'Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did. I am to doe\r\n'b'a good turne for them. Let the King haue the Letters I haue\r\n'b'sent, and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest\r\n'b'flye death. I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee\r\n'b'dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter.\r\n'b'These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am. Rosincrance\r\n'b'and Guildensterne, hold their course for England. Of them\r\n'b'I haue much to tell thee, Farewell.\r\n'b'He that thou knowest thine,\r\n'b'Hamlet.\r\n'b'Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,\r\n'b"And do't the speedier, that you may direct me\r\n"b'To him from whom you brought them.\r\n'b'Enter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter King and Laertes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,\r\n'b'And you must put me in your heart for Friend,\r\n'b'Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,\r\n'b'That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,\r\n'b'Pursued my life\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. It well appeares. But tell me,\r\n'b'Why you proceeded not against these feates,\r\n'b'So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,\r\n'b'As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,\r\n'b"You mainly were stirr'd vp?\r\n"b'  King. O for two speciall Reasons,\r\n'b'Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,\r\n'b'And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,\r\n'b'Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,\r\n'b'My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,\r\n'b"She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;\r\n"b'That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,\r\n'b'I could not but by her. The other Motiue,\r\n'b'Why to a publike count I might not go,\r\n'b'Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,\r\n'b'Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,\r\n'b'Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,\r\n'b'Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes\r\n'b'Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,\r\n'b'Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,\r\n'b"And not where I had arm'd them\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Laer. And so haue I a Noble Father lost,\r\n'b'A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,\r\n'b'Who was (if praises may go backe againe)\r\n'b'Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age\r\n'b'For her perfections. But my reuenge will come\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Breake not your sleepes for that,\r\n'b'You must not thinke\r\n'b'That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,\r\n'b'That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,\r\n'b'And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,\r\n'b"I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,\r\n"b'And that I hope will teach you to imagine-\r\n'b'Enter a Messenger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'How now? What Newes?\r\n'b'  Mes. Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your\r\n'b'Maiesty: this to the Queene\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?\r\n'b'  Mes. Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:\r\n'b"They were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   King. Laertes you shall heare them:\r\n'b'Leaue vs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exit Messenger\r\n'b'\r\n'b'High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your\r\n'b'Kingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly\r\n'b'Eyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount\r\n'b"th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.\r\n"b'Hamlet.\r\n'b'What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?\r\n'b'Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?\r\n'b'  Laer. Know you the hand?\r\n'b"  Kin. 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript\r\n"b'here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?\r\n'b"  Laer. I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,\r\n"b'It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,\r\n'b'That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;\r\n'b'Thus diddest thou\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Kin. If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:\r\n'b"How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?\r\n"b"  Laer. If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Kin. To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,\r\n"b'As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes\r\n'b'No more to vndertake it; I will worke him\r\n'b'To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,\r\n'b'Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\r\n'b'And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,\r\n'b'But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,\r\n'b'And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence\r\n'b'Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,\r\n'b"I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,\r\n"b'And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant\r\n'b"Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,\r\n"b'And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,\r\n'b"As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd\r\n"b'With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,\r\n'b'That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,\r\n'b'Come short of what he did\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Laer. A Norman was't?\r\n"b'  Kin. A Norman\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Vpon my life Lamound\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Kin. The very same\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer.

Hee mad confession of you,\r\n'b'And gaue you such a Masterly report,\r\n'b'For Art and exercise in your defence;\r\n'b'And for your Rapier most especiall,\r\n'b"That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,\r\n"b'If one could match you Sir. This report of his\r\n'b'Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,\r\n'b'That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,\r\n'b'Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;\r\n'b'Now out of this\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Why out of this, my Lord?\r\n'b'  Kin. Laertes was your Father deare to you?\r\n'b'Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,\r\n'b'A face without a heart?\r\n'b'  Laer. Why aske you this?\r\n'b'  Kin. Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,\r\n'b'But that I know Loue is begun by Time:\r\n'b'And that I see in passages of proofe,\r\n'b'Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:\r\n'b'Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,\r\n'b'To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,\r\n'b'More then in words?\r\n'b"  Laer. To cut his throat i'th' Church\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Kin. No place indeed should murder Sancturize;\r\n'b'Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes\r\n'b'Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,\r\n'b"Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:\r\n"b"Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,\r\n"b'And set a double varnish on the fame\r\n'b'The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,\r\n'b'And wager on your heads, he being remisse,\r\n'b'Most generous, and free from all contriuing,\r\n'b'Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,\r\n'b'Or with a little shuffling, you may choose\r\n'b'A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,\r\n'b'Requit him for your Father\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Laer. I will doo't.\r\n"b'And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:\r\n'b'I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke\r\n'b'So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,\r\n'b'Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,\r\n'b'Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue\r\n'b'Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,\r\n'b'That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,\r\n'b'With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,\r\n'b'It may be death\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Kin. Let's further thinke of this,\r\n"b'Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes\r\n'b'May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;\r\n'b'And that our drift looke through our bad performance,\r\n'b"'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect\r\n"b'Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,\r\n'b'If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see\r\n'b"Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,\r\n"b"I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,\r\n"b'As make your bowts more violent to the end,\r\n'b"And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him\r\n"b'A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\r\n'b"If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\r\n"b'Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.\r\n'b'Enter Queene.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Queen.

Alas then, is she drown'd?\r\n"b"  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,\r\n'b'And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet\r\n'b'It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,\r\n'b'Let shame say what it will; when these are gone\r\n'b'The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,\r\n'b'I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,\r\n'b'But that this folly doubts it.\r\n'b'Enter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b"  Kin.

How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in\r\n'b'her owne defence?\r\n'b"  Other. Why 'tis found so\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Clo. It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for\r\n'b'heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues\r\n'b'an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an\r\n'b"Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe\r\n"b'wittingly\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Other. Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Clown. Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:\r\n'b'heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water\r\n'b'and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;\r\n'b'marke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne\r\n'b'him; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not\r\n'b'guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Other.

That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing\r\n'b"once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it\r\n"b'were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It\r\n'b"might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:\r\n"b'one that could circumuent God, might it not?\r\n'b'  Hor. It might, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow\r\n'b'sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this\r\n'b"might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such\r\n"b'a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?\r\n'b'  Hor. I, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,\r\n"b'Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons\r\n'b"Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to\r\n"b"see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but\r\n"b"to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke\r\n"b"on't\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,\r\n'b'for and a shrowding-Sheete:\r\n'b'O a Pit of Clay for to be made,\r\n'b'for such a Guest is meete\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. There's another: why might not that bee the\r\n"b'Scull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his\r\n'b'Quillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why\r\n'b"doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about\r\n"b'the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of\r\n'b"his Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's\r\n"b'time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,\r\n'b'his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:\r\n'b'Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,\r\n'b'to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his\r\n'b'Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double\r\n'b'ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of\r\n'b'Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will\r\n'b'hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe\r\n'b'haue no more? ha?\r\n'b'  Hor. Not a iot more, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?\r\n'b'  Hor. I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance\r\n'b"in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's\r\n"b'this Sir?\r\n'b'  Clo. Mine Sir:\r\n'b'O a Pit of Clay for to be made,\r\n'b'for such a Guest is meete\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Clo. You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:\r\n"b"for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:\r\n"b"'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou\r\n"b'lyest\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Clo. 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me\r\n"b'to you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. What man dost thou digge it for?\r\n'b'  Clo. For no man Sir\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. What woman then?\r\n'b'  Clo. For none neither\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?\r\n"b'  Clo. One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,\r\n'b"shee's dead\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake\r\n'b'by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the\r\n'b'Lord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,\r\n'b'the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant\r\n'b'comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his\r\n'b'Kibe. How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?\r\n'b"  Clo. Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day\r\n"b"that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. How long is that since?\r\n'b'  Clo. Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:\r\n'b'It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee\r\n'b'that was mad, and sent into England\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I marry, why was he sent into England?\r\n'b'  Clo. Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his\r\n'b"wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Why?\r\n'b"  Clo. 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as\r\n"b'mad as he\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. How came he mad?\r\n'b'  Clo. Very strangely they say\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. How strangely?\r\n'b"  Clo. Faith e'ene with loosing his wits\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Vpon what ground?\r\n'b'  Clo. Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene\r\n'b'heere, man and Boy thirty yeares\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?\r\n"b'  Clo. Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue\r\n'b'many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold\r\n'b'the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine\r\n'b'yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Why he, more then another?\r\n'b"  Clo. Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that\r\n"b'he will keepe out water a great while. And your water,\r\n'b'is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull\r\n'b'now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Whose was it?\r\n'b'  Clo. A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;\r\n'b'Whose doe you thinke it was?\r\n'b'  Ham. Nay, I know not\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a\r\n"b'Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull\r\n'b'Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. This?\r\n'b"  Clo. E'ene that\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,\r\n'b'a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he\r\n'b'hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how\r\n'b'abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere\r\n'b'hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.\r\n'b'Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your\r\n'b'Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to\r\n'b'set the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own\r\n'b'Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies\r\n'b'Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this\r\n'b'fauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prythee\r\n'b'Horatio tell me one thing\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hor. What's that my Lord?\r\n"b"  Ham. Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion\r\n"b"i'th' earth?\r\n"b"  Hor. E'ene so\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. And smelt so? Puh\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hor. E'ene so, my Lord\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. To what base vses we may returne Horatio.\r\n'b'Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,\r\n'b'till he find it stopping a bunghole\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hor. 'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether\r\n'b'with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.\r\n'b'Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth\r\n'b'into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make\r\n'b'Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)\r\n'b'might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?\r\n'b"Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,\r\n"b'Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.\r\n'b'Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,\r\n'b"Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.\r\n"b'But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.\r\n'b'Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,\r\n'b'And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,\r\n'b'The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,\r\n'b"Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.\r\n"b'Couch we a while, and mark\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. What Cerimony else?\r\n'b'  Ham. That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. What Cerimony else?\r\n'b"  Priest. Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.\r\n"b'As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,\r\n'b"And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,\r\n"b"She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,\r\n"b'Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,\r\n'b'Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:\r\n'b'Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,\r\n'b'Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home\r\n'b'Of Bell and Buriall\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Must there no more be done ?\r\n'b'  Priest. No more be done:\r\n'b'We should prophane the seruice of the dead,\r\n'b'To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her\r\n'b'As to peace-parted Soules\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Laer. Lay her i'th' earth,\r\n"b'And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,\r\n'b'May Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest)\r\n'b'A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,\r\n'b'When thou liest howling?\r\n'b'  Ham. What, the faire Ophelia?\r\n'b'  Queene. Sweets, to the sweet farewell.\r\n'b"I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:\r\n"b'I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)\r\n'b"And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Laer. Oh terrible woer,\r\n'b'Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head\r\n'b'Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence\r\n'b"Depriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while,\r\n"b'Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Leaps in the graue.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,\r\n'b'Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,\r\n'b"To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head\r\n"b'Of blew Olympus\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. What is he, whose griefes\r\n'b'Beares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow\r\n'b'Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand\r\n'b'Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,\r\n'b'Hamlet the Dane\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer. The deuill take thy soule\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Thou prai'st not well,\r\n"b'I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;\r\n'b'Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,\r\n'b'Yet haue I something in me dangerous,\r\n'b'Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   King. Pluck them asunder\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Hamlet, Hamlet\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Gen. Good my Lord be quiet\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.\r\n'b'Vntill my eielids will no longer wag\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Qu. Oh my Sonne, what Theame?\r\n'b"  Ham. I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers\r\n"b'Could not (with all there quantitie of Loue)\r\n'b'Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?\r\n'b'  King. Oh he is mad Laertes,\r\n'b'  Qu. For loue of God forbeare him\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Come show me what thou'lt doe.\r\n"b"Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?\r\n"b"Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?\r\n"b"Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;\r\n"b'To outface me with leaping in her Graue?\r\n'b'Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.\r\n'b'And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw\r\n'b'Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground\r\n'b'Sindging his pate against the burning Zone,\r\n'b"Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thou'lt mouth,\r\n"b'Ile rant as well as thou\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Kin. This is meere Madnesse:\r\n'b'And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:\r\n'b'Anon as patient as the female Doue,\r\n'b"When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;\r\n"b'His silence will sit drooping\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Heare you Sir:\r\n'b'What is the reason that you vse me thus?\r\n'b"I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:\r\n"b'Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may,\r\n'b'The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.\r\n'b'Enter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Kin. I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,\r\n'b'Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech,\r\n'b"Wee'l put the matter to the present push:\r\n"b'Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,\r\n'b'This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:\r\n'b'An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;\r\n'b'Till then, in patience our proceeding be.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exeunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Enter Hamlet and Horatio\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,\r\n'b'You doe remember all the Circumstance\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Remember it my Lord?\r\n'b'  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,\r\n'b'That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay\r\n'b'Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,\r\n'b'(And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,\r\n'b'Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,\r\n'b'When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,\r\n'b"There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,\r\n"b'Rough-hew them how we will\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. That is most certaine\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Vp from my Cabin\r\n'b'My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,\r\n'b"Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,\r\n"b"Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew\r\n"b'To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,\r\n'b'(My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale\r\n'b'Their grand Commission, where I found Horatio,\r\n'b'Oh royall knauery: An exact command,\r\n'b'Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;\r\n'b'Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,\r\n'b'With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,\r\n'b'That on the superuize no leasure bated,\r\n'b'No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,\r\n'b'My head should be struck off\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Ist possible?\r\n'b"  Ham. Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:\r\n"b'But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?\r\n'b'  Hor. I beseech you\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Being thus benetted round with Villaines,\r\n'b'Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,\r\n'b'They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,\r\n'b"Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,\r\n"b'I once did hold it as our Statists doe,\r\n'b'A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much\r\n'b'How to forget that learning: but Sir now,\r\n'b'It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know\r\n'b'The effects of what I wrote?\r\n'b'  Hor. I, good my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. An earnest Coniuration from the King,\r\n'b'As England was his faithfull Tributary,\r\n'b'As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,\r\n'b'As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,\r\n'b"And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,\r\n"b'And many such like Assis of great charge,\r\n'b'That on the view and know of these Contents,\r\n'b'Without debatement further, more or lesse,\r\n'b'He should the bearers put to sodaine death,\r\n'b'Not shriuing time allowed\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Hor. How was this seal'd?\r\n"b'  Ham. Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;\r\n'b'I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,\r\n'b'Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:\r\n'b'Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,\r\n'b"Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,\r\n"b'The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day\r\n'b'Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,\r\n'b"Thou know'st already\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Hor. So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Why man, they did make loue to this imployment\r\n'b'They are not neere my Conscience; their debate\r\n'b'Doth by their owne insinuation grow:\r\n'b"'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes\r\n"b'Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points\r\n'b'Of mighty opposites\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Why, what a King is this?\r\n'b'  Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon\r\n'b"He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,\r\n"b"Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,\r\n"b'Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,\r\n'b"And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,\r\n"b"To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd\r\n"b'To let this Canker of our nature come\r\n'b'In further euill\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. It must be shortly knowne to him from England\r\n'b'What is the issue of the businesse there\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. It will be short,\r\n'b"The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more\r\n"b'Then to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,\r\n'b'That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;\r\n'b'For by the image of my Cause, I see\r\n'b'The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:\r\n'b'But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me\r\n'b'Into a Towring passion\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Peace, who comes heere?\r\n'b'Enter young Osricke.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Osr. Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?\r\n'b'  Hor. No my good Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to\r\n"b'know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast\r\n'b'be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings\r\n'b"Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession\r\n"b'of dirt\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Osr. Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,\r\n'b'I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put\r\n'b"your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Osr. I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Ham. No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is\r\n"b'Northerly\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Osr. It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my\r\n'b'Complexion\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Osr. Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere\r\n"b'I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie\r\n'b"to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:\r\n"b'Sir, this is the matter\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I beseech you remember\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Osr. Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:\r\n'b'Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at\r\n'b'his weapon\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. What's his weapon?\r\n"b'  Osr. Rapier and dagger\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well\r\n"b'\r\n'b"   Osr. The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,\r\n"b"against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French\r\n"b'Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,\r\n'b'Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very\r\n'b'deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate\r\n'b'carriages, and of very liberall conceit\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. What call you the Carriages?\r\n'b'  Osr. The Carriages Sir, are the hangers\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. The phrase would bee more Germaine to the\r\n'b'matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would\r\n'b'it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses\r\n'b'against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three\r\n'b"liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against\r\n"b"the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?\r\n"b'  Osr. The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene\r\n'b'you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;\r\n'b'He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to\r\n'b'imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the\r\n'b'Answere\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. How if I answere no?\r\n'b'  Osr. I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person\r\n'b'in tryall\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please\r\n'b"his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let\r\n"b'the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the\r\n'b'King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if\r\n'b'not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Osr. Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?\r\n"b'  Ham. To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature\r\n'b'will\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Osr. I commend my duty to your Lordship\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it\r\n'b"himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Hor. This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his\r\n'b'head\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. He did Complie with his Dugge before hee\r\n'b"suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty\r\n"b'that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of\r\n'b'the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of\r\n'b'yesty collection, which carries them through & through\r\n'b'the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow\r\n'b'them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. You will lose this wager, my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,\r\n'b'I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the\r\n'b'oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about\r\n'b'my heart: but it is no matter\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. Nay, good my Lord\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of\r\n'b'gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Hor. If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestall\r\n'b'their repaire hither, and say you are not fit\r\n'b'\r\n'b"   Ham. Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall\r\n"b"Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not\r\n"b'to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it\r\n'b'be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no\r\n'b"man ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?\r\n"b'Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with\r\n'b'Foyles,\r\n'b'and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  Kin.

What I haue done\r\n'b'That might your nature honour, and exception\r\n'b'Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:\r\n'b"Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.\r\n"b'If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:\r\n'b"And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,\r\n"b'Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:\r\n'b"Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,\r\n"b"Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,\r\n"b'His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.\r\n'b'Sir, in this Audience,\r\n'b"Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,\r\n"b'Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,\r\n'b"That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,\r\n"b'And hurt my Mother\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Laer.

I do not feare it,\r\n'b'I haue seene you both:\r\n'b"But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes\r\n"b'\r\n'b'   Laer. This is too heauy,\r\n'b'Let me see another\r\n'b'\r\n'b'   Ham.
