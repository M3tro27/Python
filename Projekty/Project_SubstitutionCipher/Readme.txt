The reason I created this project:
    I want to create a program that can encrypt a piece of text.

Do you know Caesar cipher? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
    This is a form of substitution cipher in which each character is replaced by another, located a specified distance
    from it in the alphabet. For example with a displacement of 3, D will become A, E will become B, and so on.

    However, it is very easy to break. If we predict the result of decoding or analyzing the character frequency. 
    For example, in English the letter e appears the most. Otherwise we only need to consider (n-1) cases if there 
    are n characters in the alphabet.

Matematika:
    So I want to replace 1 character to any character. Potřebuji zobrazení: abeceda->abeceda. (Zobrazení musí být bijektivní)
    Použiji jsem zápis zobrazení téměr stejný, jako jsme použivali v M2. př z=(123)(45)(6)

Application of program:
    I'm not sure. You can use it to encrypt your messages on Messenger. Don't be afraid of anyone peeking into your
    messages anymore, including Facebook.
    Maybe I will create a website or app based on it.
